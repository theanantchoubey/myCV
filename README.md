# myCV
This is my CV website made up of pure HTML.
I created this website in order to revise concepts of HTML and practice it.
From a long time I wanted to have a website with pure HTML code and here it is , this CV website had 100% of it's code as HTML5.
I have used just basic HTML code in the initial version of this website and however I will add more in the coming time.
